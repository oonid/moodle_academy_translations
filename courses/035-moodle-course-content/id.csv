<p>To benefit most from this course, you should have an empty Moodle course in which you have the role of editing teacher. It is very useful also to have a sample student account which you can use to test your activities.</p>
<p>Ideally, your organisation will provide you with a course with teacher access and offer you a test student account.</p>
<p>If that is not possible you can use our <a href=""https://sandbox.moodledemo.net"" target=""_blank"">Moodle sandbox demo</a> with the teacher login (username = teacher/password= sandbox) but be aware that this site is reset every hour so you won't be able to save your work.</p>
