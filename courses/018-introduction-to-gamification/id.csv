<p>However.. we must carefully consider how our learners are motivated, and ensure our gamified course does not have the opposite effect from what we wish.Here are two types of motivation:</p>
<h5>Extrinsic motivation</h5>
<p>This means that the desire to learn comes from outside - an external source, rather than the genuine desire of the learner. Perhaps they want to study because they know it will improve their chances of a good job or a promotion? Perhaps they want to study because they need a certain qualification in order to study something they genuinely prefer? Gamification tends to work well when learners are extrinsically motivated. A small reward, a digital badge, some hidden treasure (stash) can give them a sense of satisfaction and achievement to encourage them onto the next stage in their learning.</p>
<h5>Intrinsic motivation</h5>
<p>This means that the desire to learn comes from inside - the learner does not necessarily have an end goal in mind such as a promotion; they are simply learning for the pleasure or mental challenge of it. Be careful when gamifying your course when you know your learners are instrinsically motivated. For some intrinsically motivated learners badges, points, leaderboards can in fact appear patronising if the learner was planning to do the tasks anyway. Research shows that in some cases, gamification can have a negative effect on intrinsically motivated learners.</p><p>Bear in mind that it is possible for a learner to be both extrinsically and intrinsically motivated.</p>",,id,3119

The Observatory of Educational Innovation (Tecnologica de Monterrey) identifies six classifications of participant.</p>
<p>It's not possible for every aspect of a gamified environment to cater equally for all these different motivations, and the goal of a particular module might have a bias in favour of one over all others. Nevertheless, recognising that this sort of diversity is likely to be present in a given student population will be helpful in designing, implementing, and evaluating a gamification strategy.
</p>
<p>In this Lesson you will explore the six classifications and check your understanding with a few questions. You should spend at least ten minutes reading and responding to the questions. </p>

<p>In addition to three core exams and a project, the class was given five extra assignments which could earn them additional points. Points were subtracted for failed exams. A points leaderboard was visible to all students. Students competed for a pre-defined set of grades with the highest score getting the highest grade, then the next two highest scores receiving half a point less on their grade; the next three, one point less, and so on.</p>
<p>The class achieved a higher attendance level, greater participation in additional activities, and improved project completion times, compared with other groups in the same course. However students with lower scores reported being less motivated. (Laskowski, 2015).</p>",,id,5269

<p>Gamification was implemented in undergraduate Computer Organization and graduate Cloud Computing courses in response to the growing number of exam failures. Class activities were designed to engage in different ways the student types: explorers, achievers, socializers and winners. The explorers had multiple paths to explore, achievers had different progress options, socializers benefit from participating in teams, and winners compete in challenges presented by laboratory work and in-class discussions. In addition a points-scale was set that requires 10,000 points for a top grade, with tokens are available for unlocking different rewards levels. In addition to these gamification elements, game analytics were deployed to monitor student progress and engagement based on quizzes, and results used to target guidance resources where most necessary.</p>
<p>An increase in student participation levels and numbers of students passing exams was observed following this gamification initiative. (Losup and Epema, 2014).</p>",,id,5269

<p>Four medals were awarded during the course for quality of contribution, fulfilment of assignments, willingness and collaboration, and attendance and punctuality. A listing of awarded medals (represented by icons) was published mid-term, and at the end of the semester. Students achieving all four medals get an outstanding performance certificate attached to their student record. Another strategy deployed were team-based quizzes using the Kahoot! and Socrative apps, with grade points on offer to the top three scorers.</p>
<p>Teachers reported that having been a little wary at first, students responded positively as they realised the gamified activities involved some team competition, fun, and the possibility of extra grade points.</p>",,id,5269

<p>Professor Cliff Lampe has become regarded as a leading innovator in higher level education gamification. He teaches an introductory course to 200 students, and has successfully integrated gamification strategies to engage and expand student’s interest in the course. Perhaps most notably, he has designed a means whereby students have autonomy in how they navigate assignments and assessments. For example, students can choose to complete an assessment by creating an infographic on a particular topic rather than sit a more conventional test. In addition, teamwork and role-play are facilitated though the establishment of ‘guilds’ and his class is supported by teaching assistants who maintain progress scoreboards.</p><p>
</p><p>Lampe has received testimonies from his former students pointing out that they have a better recollection of the class experience and the course content compared to others classes. (Weng Mak, 2103)</p>",,id,5269

<p>Professor Alex Nagurney in Hawaii engaged Texas-based instructional designer Patrick Smith to create a series of videos in which he described behavioural problems he was experiencing at his college in Texas, on the pretext that he was looking for help from his friend’s the class in Hawaii.  In fact all the problems were based on experiences in the Hawaii campus, with local ethnic dynamics being transposed and disguised as Texan-Californian tensions. Nagurney arranged students into teams who would propose interventions, following which he cast the students as individual consultants to examine and comment on the various proposals.</p>
<p>Aligning this exercise with other game elements such as a rewards system that took into account different student types, Nagurney reports that student participation in online forums increased by 143% following this gamification initiative.</p>",,id,5269
