<p>To benefit most from this course, you should have an empty Moodle course in which you have the role of editing teacher. It is very useful also to have a sample student account which you can use to test your activities.</p>
<p>Ideally, your organisation will provide you with a course with teacher access and offer you a test student account.</p>
<p>If that is not possible you can use our <a href=""https://sandbox.moodledemo.net"" target=""_blank"">Moodle sandbox demo</a> with the teacher login (username = teacher/password= sandbox) but be aware that this site is reset every hour so you won't be able to save your work.</p>

    <li>A Glossary typically contains a list of definitions, perhaps of key terms in your subject.</li>

    <li>You can have more than one glossary but only one is the 'main' one into which other glossary entries can be imported.</li>
    <li>Glossary entries can be moderated before they appear; learners can comment on others' entries and you can choose to allow or prevent duplicate entries. Keywords may be entered, each on a separate line.</li>

        <li>The H5P filter displays embedded H5P in the editor.</li>
        <li>The emoticons filter will display combinations of : and ) as ðŸ˜Š. (Note your admin might have enabled emojis, meaning you can select emojis from the&nbsp; text editor too.)</li>

    <li>Although the administrator decides which filters to make available, course teachers can view the list from <strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Filters</strong> in the course navigation, and can also change filters for individual activities from the <strong>More</strong> link within each activity.

    <li>It is possible to give everyone their own individual wiki, for personal notes perhaps, but usually a wiki is a joint effort.</li>
    <li>Be aware that there are sometimes issues when several participants are trying to edit the wiki at the same time - they might see a ""locked"" message. As the teacher you are able to override this.</li>
    <li>Note too that it's possible to link to any online collaborative doc (Google Doc, Office 365, NextCloud, Etherpad etc) by using a URL resource, if your students are more familiar with them.</li>

    <li>Moodle's Assignment activity provides a space into which students can submit work for teachers to grade and give feedback on.</li>
    <li>This saves on paper and is better than email because you don't have to find your students' work amongst emails from colleagues or companies; their submissions are together on one screen of your course.</li>
    <li>You can require them to submit one or several files and/or to type text essays.</li>
    <li>It is possible to have them submit work as a group and you can also choose as a teacher to grade their work 'blind' in other words not to see the identities of those who have submitted assignments.</li>
    <li>Assignments can have a deadlines and cut-off dates - which you can also extend if necessary.</li><li>You can set a timed assignment if enabled by admin. Learners can still complete the assignment after the time is up, but it will be shown as submitted after the time limit.</li>
    <li>If you as a teacher want to see a reminder to grade, make sure you select a date in the <strong>Remind me to grade by...</strong>&nbsp;setting when creating your assignment.</li>
