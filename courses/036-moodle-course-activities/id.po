"    <li>Glossary entries can be moderated before they appear; learners can comment on others' entries and you can choose to allow or prevent duplicate entries. Keywords may be entered, each on a separate line.</li>\n"
"    <li>If you have enabled the Glossary auto-linking filter, then when glossary terms appear in your course they will be automatically linked to the glossary entry.</li>\n"
