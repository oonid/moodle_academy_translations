    <li>Learning resources are added by enabling Edit mode top right&nbsp; and then clicking Add an activity or resource at the bottom of one of the course sections. This opens up the <a href=""/mod/book/view.php?id=629&amp;chapterid=906"">Activity chooser.</a></li>
    <li>An 'activity' is something a learner interacts with, like an Assignment or Quiz.</li>
    <li>A 'resource' is static content that is read, watched or listened to, like a video file or a PDF.</li>
    <li>Along with activities and resources, teachers can add content from <a href=""https://moodle.net"">MoodleNet</a>, Moodle's site for finding, sharing and curating open educational content. The link to MoodleNet needs to be enabled from Site administration &gt; Advanced features &gt;Enable MoodleNet integration.</li>
    <li>Blocks provide extra learning content or information and&nbsp; may&nbsp; be added to the side of the main course content from the Block drawer on the right.</li>
</ul>
<p>The video below explains how to add course content. The transcript and mp4 video may be downloaded from the section:&nbsp;<a href=""https://moodle.academy/course/view.php?id=39#section-4"">Videos and transcripts for download.</a><br></p>
